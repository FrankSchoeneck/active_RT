# active RT
A Mapsforge Rendertheme

The active RT theme is designed for clarity of display for hiking.

Its colours and styles are based on german Outdooractive maps.
The theme is designed to work well with maps from Locus Store (LoMaps) and OpenAndroMaps.

You can choose overlays for waymarked trails in transparent or colored mode when you select the theme in the Locus Maps app.
In LoMaps the trails are displayed with the corresponding way symbols (according OSMC).

It automatically scales for devices with displays of different resolutions and symbols enlarge smoothly for higher zoom levels.
The zoom levels at which various features appear has been adjusted to provide optimal information and reduce unwanted clutter.
