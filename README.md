# active RT
A Mapsforge Rendertheme

The active RT theme is designed for clarity of display for hiking.

Its colours and styles are based on german Outdooractive maps.
The theme is designed to work well with maps from Locus Store (LoMaps) and OpenAndroMaps.

You can choose overlays for waymarked trails in transparent or colored mode when you select the theme in the Locus Maps app.
In LoMaps the trails are displayed with the corresponding way symbols (according OSMC).

It automatically scales for devices with displays of different resolutions and symbols enlarge smoothly for higher zoom levels.
The zoom levels at which various features appear has been adjusted to provide optimal information and reduce unwanted clutter.

### Info
The numbers mean the used render theme version of Mapsforge, not the map version. This is separate from each other, each rendering theme version has changes to the instruction set. Unfortunately, Locus is given by the programming of the app which theme version is used in which map version.

The active RT3 Locus version works only with locus and maps of version 3 and earlier.

The active RT4 version works with all apps that use the Mapsforge Engine and that with all map versions, here is Locus unfortunately again special, there this version works only with maps of version 4 and higher.

The active RT5 version is older than the RT4 version and was only for testing which app works with version 5 rendering themes.

As it looks at the moment I will make a current active RT5 version of the current active RT4 version and then only maintain it, the active RT4 will be omitted and the active RT3 locus stay on this stand.
